                    <h1>Background</h1>
                    <p>I'm Alyssa Eilermann, a 24-year-old with a journey that's been as diverse as it's been rewarding. Born and raised in Saint Louis, Missouri, I started life as an only child with my mom by my side. After high school, I embarked on a quest for knowledge at the University of Missouri, only to realize after a year that my true path lay elsewhere. I took the leap into the world of full-time work, seeking my passion and life's calling. This quest led me to Kansas City, where I embraced new experiences for several years. However, my journey eventually led me back home to Saint Louis, where I cherished moments with my beloved brothers for a few months. Currently, I reside in Columbia, Missouri, with my boyfriend, supporting him as he furthers his education. Life's journey may have its twists and turns, but I'm excited to embrace each step as it comes</p>

                    <h1>My Likes/ Dislikes</h1>
                    <p>I find immense joy in the simple and complex wonders of life. Nature has a special place in my heart, and I cherish every opportunity to explore the great outdoors, be it in parks, on beaches, along lakeshores, or by the riverside. Although I don't get to indulge in nature as often as I'd like, I feel most at home when surrounded by the beauty of the natural world. On the other hand, my love for adventure extends to exploring vibrant cities and experiencing the pulse of urban life. The idea of staying in one place for too long hardly appeals to me, as I'm always eager to travel and see more of the world. Family holds a special place in my heart, especially spending time with my little brothers, aged 5 and 2, who light up my world with their innocence and energy. My creative spirit finds its outlet in web development and photography, where I can bring my ideas to life and share my unique perspective with the world.</p>

                <h1>What Excites Me</h1>
                <p>What truly excites me is the art of creating and curating spaces. Watching videos of people decorating their homes fills me with inspiration and excitement. The prospect of designing my own space, crafting an atmosphere that's both cozy and tranquil, brings immense joy. Cozy aesthetics hold a special place in my heart, from the ambiance of coffee shops and soft blankets to the allure of dimly lit rooms where I can relax, watching movies as rain or snow falls outside. My journey into web development has been a thrilling adventure, offering an outlet to bring my ideas and creativity to life. This newfound passion has filled a creative void I've been searching to fill for a long time. Equally exhilarating is the prospect of traveling the world, immersing myself in new environments, and embracing diverse cultures. These are the sources of excitement that fuel my journey in web development and in life.</p>

            <h1>Web Development Journey</h1>
            <p>My journey into the world of web development had an unexpected and life-changing beginning. In the summer of 2022, while traveling through Europe, I crossed paths with a fellow traveler who exuded boundless enthusiasm while sharing her experiences as a web developer. Her joy and excitement ignited a spark within me, leaving me eager to explore this intriguing field. At that time, I found myself in a comfortable but unfulfilled phase of life, sensing that there was something more waiting for me. However, upon returning home, the demands of reality took precedence, and my newfound inspiration took a backseat. It wasn't until about six months ago that I recalled that transformative conversation and decided to take the leap. I delved into web development, starting with self-teaching through YouTube videos, reading documentation, and completing courses like FreeCodeCamp. In under a month, I dedicated over 300 hours to learning and earned a certification. My days were filled with coffee shop and library sessions, completely immersed in this journey. I woke up each day with excitement, eager to delve deeper into this world of coding and problem-solving. Building webpages from scratch, implementing my own ideas, and deciphering code became my passion. This journey not only revealed my aptitude for logic but also ignited a newfound love for the process of creation, embracing the blend of creativity and logic that web development offers.</p>

            <h1>Job History</h1>
            <p>My journey in the world of work began during my senior year of high school when I served as a camp counselor at a summer camp for children with autism. It was an incredibly fun and rewarding first job that left a lasting impression. Upon entering college and subsequently leaving after a year, I transitioned into a role as a pre-K assistant teacher at a daycare center, where I cherished the opportunity to witness the daily growth and learning of young minds. Relocating to Kansas City prompted a change, leading me to work as a front desk associate at an eyecare center, honing my organizational and customer service skills. Unfortunately, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic led to a layoff, and I took on various roles, from warehouse work to employment at Walmart. As the world began to stabilize post-pandemic, I resumed my job search, ultimately becoming a primary assistant and manager at Preferred Family Healthcare, where I contributed to the well-being of 10 clients with disabilities. My responsibilities included overseeing staff, handling administrative tasks, such as paperwork and appointments, and ensuring the smooth operation of the facility. My journey then led me back to Saint Louis, where I explored photography and took up Uber as a source of income. I continue with photography and Uber while pursuing my dream job as a web developer.</p>

                <h1>Challenges</h1>
                <p>Throughout my journey, I've encountered several challenges that have tested my resolve and determination. The feeling of not doing enough and the perception of slow progress often crept in, especially as I took on the role of both student and teacher. Self-guided learning meant creating my schedule and navigating my path, often unsure if I was on the right track. Imposter syndrome and doubts about my employability without a college degree occasionally cast shadows. Designing sleek, professional, and appealing web interfaces posed its own set of hurdles. Despite these challenges, each day presented new opportunities for growth and learning. I've come to realize that coding isn't about perfection but about continuous skill development. Keeping this mindset at the forefront has made the journey more manageable. I'm aware that everyone starts somewhere, and the only true failure is giving up. It's the persistence and the journey of learning and improvement that make this experience incredibly rewarding.</p>

                <h1>Goals</h1>
                <p>My current goals revolve around finding a company that shares my passion and vision for web development. I aspire to work with a team of individuals who not only have a genuine enthusiasm for the field but are also eager to mentor and nurture my growth. Ideally, I'm looking for an opportunity where someone is willing to take a chance on me, welcoming me into their team and providing the training and guidance needed to evolve into a skilled web developer. In addition to a fulfilling career, I seek a balance between work and personal life while enjoying a stable income. The allure of the tech industry lies in its potential to provide both.
